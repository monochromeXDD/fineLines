intern project for ALBA
will add a description later

temporary description:
  the end goal is to build a webTool that has a chatBot to answer company specific question about the fine print of the company in a simple and easy to undertsand manner so users dont have to go through reading the massive blocks of text and reading the laws of the land and have a degree in law just for understading the return policy of something. or something like "are headphones allowed in the office building". or for a company like AlBa where satefy is paramout, there can be very specific and confusin  quesitons that may come to users' mind like "is it necessary to wear PPE kits and boots if i need to rest in the cool house?".
