#weâ€™ll split the Document into chunks for embedding and vector storage.
#we use a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.
#this is simple document splitting method using common separatos, there are also other more efficient methods for larger files, read how-to-guides or RAG tut on langchain
